# Netherland Centre for River Studies (NCR) LaTeX classes

This repository provides LaTeX classes for abstract (ncr_abstract.cls) and conference proceedings (ncr_bundle.cls). 

## Installation
To use these LaTeX classes you need to:

1. Install LaTeX
2. Either install the classes to your LaTeX install or copy the .cls and .sty files to your working folder (i.e. next to your .tex files)

[1] 
- To install LaTeX on windows we strongly recommned MikTeX (https://miktex.org/)
- On Linux / OSX (to do)

[2] 
- If you install .cls and .sty packages to your tree, see the following StackOverflow post: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/2063/how-can-i-manually-install-a-package-on-miktex-windows
- Alternatively, just copy the contents of the /base and /template folder to a working directory on your local machine.
